# DEMIREL
I tried to set up a relational database for a clothing sales company.

I have designed an imaginary clothing sales company and set up the relational database using SQL Server Management. This database consists of 11 separate tables, each containing thousands of data entries. I performed the data entry process using the random module in Python and the NewID() function in SQL Management. In this project, I will share the current version of the database, starting with the installation of the database in SQL Server Management, followed by the code for inserting random data, and finally the addition of views and triggers. Now, let's begin by setting up the database in SQL Server Management.

First, download the shared database that I provided, and then open Microsoft SQL Server Management. Click on "Import Data-tier Application" as shown in the visual.

![import-database](https://github.com/esesdi/DEMIREL/assets/83536860/ab472be4-28fb-4b69-a381-606e3d9e0819)

In the second step, click "Next" on the displayed screen. In the third step, as shown in the visual, locate the path of the downloaded DEMIREL database and click "Next" again.

In the fourth step, click "Next" once again. In the fifth step, click the "Finish" button. In the sixth and final step, when the result section shows "Success," click the "Close" button. Now you can use the database.

You can now start using the database.
